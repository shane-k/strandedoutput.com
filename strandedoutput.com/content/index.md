Stranded Output is the title of a YouTube channel (which is currently dormant) I came up with which eventually became my screen name. It's obviously a
play on words with ['standard output'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams).

When I was a child I was diagnosed with [dyspraxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_coordination_disorder) which affects my motor coordination and working memory. It also has some parallels with ADHD in that
I have poor focus and attention. This means I have a tendency to get bored with things very easily and switch from hobby to hobby constantly. The upside
of all this is that I have practical experience with many, many different things. I believe people that embrace their *stranded-ness* will have all manner
of insights that are more than the sum of their parts. 

This is what I like to call "Stranded Output" - essentially it's a nerdier way of saying "jack of all trades, master of none" but a little bit deeper than
that I suppose.

Now that that's out of the way you may know me from the [Linux Lads](https://linuxlads.com) which is currently my main project. I've created this site as
an extension of the podcast where I can write about what interests me. I'll likely be adding more to this site in the future as I see it as a sort of 
repository for all my random brainwaves.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk!
