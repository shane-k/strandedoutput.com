      <description>Stranded Output is the title of a YouTube channel (which is currently dormant) I came up with which eventually became my screen name. It&amp;rsquo;s obviously a play on words with &amp;lsquo;standard output&amp;rsquo;.
When I was a child I was diagnosed with dyspraxia which affects my motor coordination and working memory. It also has some parallels with ADHD in that I have poor focus and attention. This means I have a tendency to get bored with things very easily and switch from hobby to hobby constantly.</description>
